# STERILIZATION_UNIT
Worked on a sterlization unit that written using assembly language and it was stimulated using Proteus.This unit performs sterilization by increasing temperature to maximum value (X°C). The temperature has to be maintained at the maximum value for 2 minutes before it is brought gradually to a nominal temperature value (Y°C). The time taken for bringing down the temperature can be varied between four different values used as decided by the user. A Push Button switch (Level) is available for this purpose. The number of times the key is pressed decides the speed at which then temperature should be brought down.
