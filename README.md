# STERILIZATION_UNIT
Worked on a sterlization unit that written using assembly language and it was stimulated using Proteus.<br> 
This unit performs sterilization by increasing temperature to maximum value (X°C). The temperature has to be maintained at the maximum value for 2 minutes before it is brought gradually to a nominal temperature value (Y°C). The time taken for bringing down the temperature can be varied between four different values used as decided by the user. A Push Button switch (Level) is available for this purpose. The number of times the key is pressed decides the speed at which then temperature should be brought down.
<li> 1 press – 3 Mins
<li> 2 presses – 5 Mins
<li> 3 presses – 7 Mins
<li> 4 presses – 10 Mins <br>

# Technical_Specifications
  
While the sterilization process is taking place the door to the unit must remain locked.The door can be opened only when user presses END <br>
User interface: Status LED glows as long as the sterilization process is being done.Once 30OC has been reached then the LED goes off and the door mechanism unlocks. Once the door is closed again the temperature has to be brought back to 30°C
